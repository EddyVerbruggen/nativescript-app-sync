# NativeScript plugin for CodePush

This plugin provides client-side integration for the [CodePush service](http://codepush.tools),
allowing you to easily add a dynamic update experience to your NativeScript app(s).

> BEWARE: Sometime June 2017 it is expected you can no longer create new CodePush apps anymore. Apps created beforehand will continue to work for the foreseeable future though. The exact date? Unknown, but you'll notice when trying to create an app with the CodePush CLI.

> UPDATE june 19 2017: The aforementioned change has been made; sadly no new CodePush NativeScript apps can be created. See [this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/435) for details.

> üì£ üì£ üì£ UPDATE may 9 2019: we're considering rebooting our efforts. Stay tuned!

## How does it work?
A NativeScript app is composed of XML/HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and any accompanying images, which are bundled together by the NativeScript CLI and distributed as part of a platform-specific binary (i.e. an .ipa or .apk file). Once the app is released, updating either the code (e.g. making bug fixes, adding new features) or image assets, requires you to recompile and redistribute the entire binary, which of course, includes any review time associated with the store(s) you are publishing to.

The CodePush plugin helps get product improvements in front of your end users instantly, by keeping your code and images synchronized with updates you release to the CodePush server. This way, your app gets the benefits of an offline mobile experience, as well as the "web-like" agility of side-loading updates as soon as they are available. It's a win-win!

In order to ensure that your end users always have a functioning version of your app, the CodePush plugin maintains a copy of the previous update, so that in the event that you accidentally push an update which includes a crash, it can automatically roll back. This way, you can rest assured that your newfound release agility won't result in users becoming blocked before you have a chance to roll back on the server. It's a win-win-win!

_To confuse you even more, have a diagram:_

### What can (and will) be CodePushed?
- Anything inside your `/app` folder.
- Anything inside your `/node_modules` folder.

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Note that we don't actually use those folders, but the `app` folder in `platforms/ios/<appname>/app` and `platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/app`, the benefit of which is we don't "care" if you use Webpack or Uglify or whatever tools you use to minify or scramble your app's assets.

### What can't (and won't):
- NativeScript platform updates. Example: bumping `tns-android` from version 2.5.1 to 2.5.2.
- Plugins updates that also require a different version of a native library it depends on.

So as long as you don't change versions of dependencies and tns platforms in your `package.json` you
can push happily. And if you do bump a version of a dependency make sure there are no changed platform libraries.

## Getting Started
> ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO test this workflow!

#### Globally install the NativeScript-compatible CodePush CLI

```shell
npm i -g nativescript-code-push-cli
```

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This will also add the global `nativescript-code-push` command to your machine.

#### Login or register with the service

Log in if you already have an account:

```shell
nativescript-code-push login
```

Register if you don't have an account yet:

```shell
nativescript-code-push register
```

#### Register your app with the service
Create an app for each OS you target:

```shell
nativescript-code-push app add MyApp-IOS ios nativescript
nativescript-code-push app add MyApp-Android android nativescript
```

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This will show you your deployment keys you'll need when connecting to the CodePush server.

#### List your registered apps

```shell
nativescript-code-push app ls
```

#### Add this plugin to your app

```shell
tns plugin add nativescript-code-push
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're restricting access to the internet from within your app, make sure you whitelist `https://nativescript-codepush-server.herokuapp.com`.

## Checking for updates
With the CodePush plugin installed and configured, the only thing left is to add the necessary code to your app to control when it checks for updates.

If an update is available, it will be silently downloaded, and installed.
 
Then based on the provided `InstallMode` the plugin either waits until the next cold start (`InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESTART`),
warm restart (`InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESUME`), or a positive response to a user prompt (`InstallMode.IMMEDIATE`).

> Also check out the [demo](/demo) for a solid example.

```typescript
// import the main plugin classes
import { CodePush } from "nativescript-code-push";

// and at some point in your app:
CodePush.sync({
  deploymentKey: "your-deployment-key" // note that this key depends on the platform you're running on (see the example below)
});
```

There's a few things you can configure - this example has all the possible options:

```typescript
import { CodePush, InstallMode, SyncStatus } from "nativescript-code-push";
import { isIOS } from "tns-core-modules/platform";

CodePush.sync({
    deploymentKey: isIOS ? "your-ios-deployment-key" : "your-android-deployment-key",
    installMode: InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESTART,    // this is the default install mode; the app updates upon the next cold boot (unless the --mandatory flag was specified while pushing the update) 
    mandatoryInstallMode: InstallMode.IMMEDIATE, // the default is InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESUME which doesn't bother the user as long as the app is in the foreground. InstallMode.IMMEDIATE shows an installation prompt. Don't use that for iOS AppStore distributions because Apple doesn't want you to.
    serverUrl: "https://your-backend.server",    // by default this is our shared cloud hosted backend server, so you probably want to leave this out
    updateDialog: { // only used for InstallMode.IMMEDIATE
      updateTitle: "Please restart the app", // an optional title shown in the update dialog 
      optionalUpdateMessage: "Optional update msg",   // a message shown for non-"--mandatory" releases 
      mandatoryUpdateMessage: "Mandatory update msg", // a message shown for "--mandatory" releases
      optionalIgnoreButtonLabel: "Later", // if a user wants to continue their session, the update will be installed on next resume
      mandatoryContinueButtonLabel: isIOS ? "Exit now" : "Restart now", // On Android we can kill and restart the app, but on iOS that's not possible so the user has to manually restart it. That's why we provide a different label in this example.
      appendReleaseDescription: true // appends the description you (optionally) provided when releasing a new version to CodePush
    }
  }, (syncStatus: SyncStatus): void => {
    console.log("CodePush syncStatus: " + syncStatus);
    if (syncStatus === SyncStatus.UP_TO_DATE) {
      console.log("CodePush: no pending updates; you're running the latest version!");
    } else if (syncStatus === SyncStatus.UPDATE_INSTALLED) {
      console.log("CodePush: update installed - it will be activated upon next cold boot");
    }
});
```

It's recommended to check for updates more than once in a cold boot cycle,
so it may be easiest to tie this check to the `resume` event:

```typescript
import * as application from "tns-core-modules/application";

// add this in some central place that's executed once in a lifecycle
application.on(application.resumeEvent, () => {
  CodePush.sync(...);
});
```

## Releasing updates
Once your app has been configured and distributed to your users, and you've made some code and/or asset changes,
it's time to instantly release them!

The easiest way to do this is to use the `release-nativescript` command in our CodePush CLI. Its (most relevant) options are:

|param|alias|default|description
|---|---|---|---
|deploymentName|d|"Staging"|Deploy to either "Staging" or "Production".
|description|des||Description of the changes made to the app with this release.
|targetBinaryVersion|t||Semver expression that specifies the binary app version(s) this release is targeting (e.g. 1.1.0, ~1.2.3).
|mandatory|m|not set, so "optional"|This specifies whether the update should be considered mandatory or not (e.g. it includes a critical security fix). This attribute is simply round tripped to the client, who can then decide if and how they would like to enforce it. This is flag, so its absence indicates an optional release.

Have a few examples for both platforms:

### iOS

```shell
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-ios-appname> ios # deploy to Staging
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-ios-appname> ios --d Production # deploy to Production (default: Staging)
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-ios-appname> ios --targetBinaryVersion ~1.0.0 # release to users running any 1.x version (default: the exact version in Info.plist)
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-ios-appname> ios --mandatory --description "My mandatory iOS version" # mandatory release for iOS 
```

### Android

```shell
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-android-appname> android # deploy to Staging
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-android-appname> android --d Production # deploy to Production (default: Staging)
nativescript-code-push release-nativescript <codepush-android-appname> android --targetBinaryVersion ~1.0.0 # release to users running any 1.x version (default: the exact version in AndroidManifest.xml)
```

### Tips
> Make sure to create a *release build* first, so use the same command that you'd use for app store distribution, just don't send it to the AppStore. You can even Webpack and Uglify your app, it's all transparent to this plugin.

> When releasing updates to CodePush, you do not need to bump your app's version since you aren't modifying the app store version at all. CodePush will automatically generate a "label" for each release you make (e.g. `v3`) in order to help identify it within your release history.

### Which releases did I create and what are the install metrics?
Using a command like this will tell you how many apps have the update installed:

```shell
nativescript-code-push deployment history <codepush-ios-appname> Staging
```

Which produces something like this:

|Label|Release Time|App Version|Mandatory|Description|Install Metrics
|---|---|---|---|---|---
|v2|an hour ago|1.0.0|Yes|Mandatory iOS version!|Active: 11% (2 of 19)
|||||Total: 2|
||||||
|v1|2 hours ago|1.0.0|No|Awesome iOS version!|Active: 26% (5 of 19)
|||||Total: 5|

### Give me the details of the current release!
This dumps the details of the most recent release for both the Staging and Production environments of your app:

```shell
nativescript-code-push deployment ls <codepush-ios-appname>
```

And if you want to dump your deployment keys as well, use:

```shell
nativescript-code-push deployment ls <codepush-ios-appname> --displayKeys
```

Which produces something like this:

|Name|Deployment Key|Update Metadata|Install Metrics
|---|---|---|---
|Production|r1DVaLfKjc0Y5d6BzqX45SFVss6a4ksvOXqog|No updates released|No installs recorded
| | | |
|Staging|YTmVMy0GLCknVu3GVIynTxmfwxJN4ksvOXqog|Label: v5|Active: 11% (2 of 19)
| | |App Version: 1.0.0|Total: 2
| | |Mandatory: Yes|
| | |Release Time: an hour ago|
| | |Released By: eddyverbruggen@gmail.com/
| | |Description: Mandatory iOS version!/

## Testing CodePush packages during development
You may want to play with CodePush before using it in production (smart move!).
Perform these steps once you've pushed an update and added the `sync` command to your app:

- `$ tns run <platform>`. On an iOS *device* add the `--release` flag so LiveSync doesn't interfere.
- kill and restart the app after the update is installed
